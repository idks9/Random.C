# Random.C
Generates a pseudo-random number, it's pretty simple to use, i think everyone would understand just by reading the code(don't worry i commented the code lol). And also, it's better to use things like the rand function of c instead of this, because the rand function was tested way more  times than mine version of it. Just created this repository to make sure i don't lose this code
